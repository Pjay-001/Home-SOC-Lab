# Home-SOC-Lab
Built a simulated Security Operations Center (SOC) environment to monitor network traffic and detect threats using the Elastic Stack (Elasticsearch, Kibana, Filebeat/Winlogbeat). This project demonstrates skills in SIEM configuration, log analysis, and threat detection, mimicking real-world SOC workflows.
